# lending club case study
> Using EDA to understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency of default



## General Information
- Background - Lending Club company is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures. Borrowers can easily access lower interest rate loans through a fast online interface. 
- Problem Statement - Lending Club wants to identify the risky loan applicants, so that such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. Our aim is to find the driving factors and features behind loan getting defaulted so that appropriate measures can be taken to mitigate this.
- Dataset - loan dataset with ~31k records, ranging from 2007-2011

* Purpose (loan purpose)
